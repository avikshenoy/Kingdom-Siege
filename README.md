# Kingdom Siege
 A strategic, methodical tower defense game. The player places down ballista turrets to defend their castle from a siege.

- Utilizes algorithms like binary search tree to facilitate enemy movement. Enemies dynamically find their own path thatâ€™s closest to their goal
- Enemies will recalculate their path if a turret is in their way
- Utilizes pure C# classes
- Utilizes advanced C# data structures such as lists, queues, and dictionaries
- Turrets dynamically build themselves when placed
- Features a currency system that balances the game. Turrets cost money to place, and enemies drop money upon death. Enemies will steal money if they make it past the player's defenses
